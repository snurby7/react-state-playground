# React State Playground

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

The purpose of this repo is to bring together a bunch of different state solutions to do the same thing.
This is inspired by the linked episode of [syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/show/272/react-state-round-up). To help address gaps in my react knowledge.

Each application will be themed around a simple list concept.

Since I love coffee, we'll just go with a coffee list.

## Operations

- Add a coffee
- Edit a coffee
- Delete a coffee
- List all coffees
- Get details on one coffee.

## State libraries and how to run the app

Before running, make sure to `yarn`

\*I have installed `nx` globally, but you can always replace `nx` in the scripts below with `yarn nx`
